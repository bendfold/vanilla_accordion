# Vanilla Accordion
This is just basic accordion build in stright up vanilla JS, no 3rd party libs.

I just wanted to see how easy it would be without jQuery.

It should be noted that this project uses some of the more modern JS & CSS methods, so is probably not going to work in older browsers. It is just an academic excercise, something to occupy my mind on my daily commute.

There is a file in here called oTools.js, its just some helper functions that I have found useful across different JS modules I have been playing with. Again its not crossbrowser tested or anything. Purely here to help out with these little experiments.
